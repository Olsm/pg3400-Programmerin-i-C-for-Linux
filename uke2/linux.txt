Good job guys!

Now you have learnt how to get files over the internet with URL.

Practical Session : 

Goals: 
- Get familiar with linux operating system
- Get comfortable with using terminal 
- Get to use several different terminal commands

Tasks:

- Play with tab:
	- Start typing command like 's' and press tab, then type 'u' and tab,
	  then type 'd' and tab
	- Use it to see the possible files
	- go into /etc directory
	- type 'cd' and space and then press tab
- Copy and paste text using mouse in the terminal
	- Use ctrl+shift+c to copy and ctrl+shift+v to paste
	- Use highlighting to copy and middle click to paste

- Mess around with files 
	- Look at the structure in /
	- look at the binaries in /bin
	- Try to locate binaries for all the commands we learnt today in the
	  lecture
	- Make a note of the ones you didnt find
- man pages
        - man man
        - read about more commands
        - try to play with the options with safe commands like cd, ls, grep

-Copy the file you downloaded to /var
        - try copying with sudo
            cp linux.txt /var/linux.txt
            Uten sudo feiler den fordi man har ikke permission
            Med sudo blir man bedt om passord og det går bra

-create a folder in your home directory
   mkdir ~/folder
- go into the folder
   cd ~/folder
- create two text files with your favorite lines in that folder
   nano text1.txt (legg til innhold og lagre)
   samme med text2.txt
- concatenate the two files and print the output to the terminal
    cat text1.txt text2.txt
- concatenate and print the output to a third file
    cat text1.txt text2.txt > text3.txt
- write a small script that takes in two files, concatenates it and puts the
  content into third file and also prints the third file to terminal
    nano myscript
      cat text1.txt text2.txt > text3.txt
      cat text3.txt
    chmod 755 myscript (gi read, write og execute permission)
    ./myscript
- Download a text file from internet - a book in text format
    wget https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pressbooks-samplefiles/MetamorphosisJ$
- dump the contents of the book in terminal
    cat Metamorphosis-jackson.pdf
- open it with less
    less Metamorphosis-jackson.pdf
- copy the downloaded book into the directory you created.
    cp Metamorphosis-jackson.pdf ~/folder/Metamorphosis-jackson.pdf
- search for some word - both case sensitive and insensitive - in the file
    grep "Title" Metamorphisis-jackson.pdf
    grep -i "metamor" Metamorphosis-jackson.pdf
- save all the lines with that word into another file
    grep -a "Title" Metamorphosis-jackson.pdf > matches.txt
      Jeg bruker -a for at grep skal behandle filen som en text fil
- go to /etc and read the contents of the file 'sudoers'
    sudo cat /etc/sudoers
- check for the permissions of that file
    filen må åpnes med sudo
    filen må redigeres med visudo som root
    det anbefales å legge til ting i /etc/sudoers.d/ istedenfor å redigere denne
- try reading it using sudo
    lese det med sudo cat går fint
- make a symbolic link to your created directory in /tmp
    ln -s folder /tmp/folder
- cd to your symbolic link
    error: Too many levels of symbolic links
- use pwd to know what your current directory is
    /tmp
- try rebooting and finding your symbolic link
    The symbolic link is gone 
    Files in tmp are saved temporary until restart
    Cleaning of tmp is done by an upstart script
    A script that runs every time tmp is mounted
    That means at every reboot
